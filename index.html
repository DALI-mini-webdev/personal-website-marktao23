            Hello everyone, my name is Mark, and I'm a '23 at Dartmouth (maybe a '24!). <br> I'm originally from Dallas, TX, where I went to high school and grew up with <br> my two older sisters. I applied to Dartmouth in 2019 and am very grateful to be here! <br> I'm planning on studying
            government with potential minors in computer science <br> and public policy, but I'm not too sure on that yet. 
            Outside of the classroom, I'm <br> mainly involved with the men's volleyball team and a really cool group on campus
            called <br> the <a href="https://www.cofired.org/">Coalition For Immigrant Reform and Equality at Dartmouth (CoFIRED) </a>. <br> Although I'm not too sure as to what I want to do post graduation, I'm thinking it'll <br> probably be something consulting-related,
            though I might plan on attending graduate school, too!
            <br>  
            <br>  
            I've always had a passion for creative building and development, and I figured this DALI course <br> represented the perfect opportunity for me to add some new skills to my repretoire
            and am very excited to <br> get to learn more about web development and more! Looking forward to the term everybody!
            <br>  
            By the way, I also have another family member: my German Shepherd. Here is a picture of him:
